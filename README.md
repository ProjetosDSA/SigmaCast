The SIGMACast is a software package that consists of a Geographic Information System (GIS) capable of performing manipulation of images and data from environmental satellites, as well as products and services derived from the Global Earth Observation System of Systems System (GEOSS).
The design of this Application began  in 2014 within a multi-institutional Project supported by the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq), designed to develop  an integrated hardware - software system capable to receiving, managing, storing, processing, manipulating and visualizing data, images and products received by stations belonging to the GEONETCast-Americas network.
The GEONETCast-Americas network is the Western GEONETCast component, with a contribution from the National Atmospheric Administration and Oceans US ( NOAA) whose aim is to allow, especially in the regions of South and Central America, better dissemination, application and exploitation of environmental data and products within the different   Areas of Social Benefits defined by the Earth Observations Group - GEO ("Group on Earth Observations"), which includes: Agriculture, Energy, Health, Climate, Weather Time, Mitigating the effects of disasters, Biodiversity, Water Resources and Ecosystems.
The GEONETCast System is a global, low cost, system for the dissemination of environmental information, that transmits through a network of commercial communications satellites, data, images and products of Meteorological and Environment Satellites, as well local data ("in situ"), and products and services from the GEOSS System ("Global Earth Observation System of Systems"), using its broadcasting capacity in broadband for multi-user, with controlled access,  using the DVB-S standard signal transmission ("Digital Video broadcasting Satellite") and may provide information in near real time.
This large volume of climatological and meteorological data developed and distributed by various institutions in different formats and spatial and temporal resolutions, and placed at the disposal of the user community by GEONETCast network; naturally aroused the need to develop a tool of the nature of SIGMACast.
From the intersection of information of different nature and from different sources is possible to infer results that would be impossible to obtain without the use of a GIS-type system. (GARDELS, 1996; Fryrear et al., 2001; De Angelis et al. 2006)
Through an user-friendly interface that uses a Web browser as interface, the SIGMACast allows the display of data in the form of geo- referenced layers. Developed only with freely available software, SIGMACast follows the specifications defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), using standards such as Web Map Service (WMS), Web Feature Service (WFS) and Web Coverage Service (WCS), to integrate their products and services.
SIGMACast allows access to a wide variety of vector data through the “Geospatial Data Abstraction Library” (GDAL / OGR) library, supporting also multiple raster formats. The system supports HDF, NetCDF, GRIB, GeoTIFF and also JPEG, GIF, PNG among others file formats.
